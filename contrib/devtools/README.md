This directory contains tools for developers working on this repository.

gen-manpages.py
===============

A small script to automatically create manpages in ../../doc/man by running the release binaries with the -help option.
This requires help2man which can be found at: https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/

This script assumes a build directory named `build` as suggested by example build documentation.
To use it with a different build directory, set `BUILDDIR`.
For example:

```bash
BUILDDIR=$PWD/my-build-dir contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.py
```

gen-freycoin-conf.sh
===================

Generates a freycoin.conf file in `share/examples/` by parsing the output from `freycoind --help`. This script is run during the
release process to include a freycoin.conf with the release binaries and can also be run by users to generate a file locally.
When generating a file as part of the release process, make sure to commit the changes after running the script.

This script assumes a build directory named `build` as suggested by example build documentation.
To use it with a different build directory, set `BUILDDIR`.
For example:

```bash
BUILDDIR=$PWD/my-build-dir contrib/devtools/gen-freycoin-conf.sh
```

circular-dependencies.py
========================

Run this script from the root of the source tree (`src/`) to find circular dependencies in the source code.
This looks only at which files include other files, treating the `.cpp` and `.h` file as one unit.

Example usage:

    cd .../src
    ../contrib/devtools/circular-dependencies.py {*,*/*,*/*/*}.{h,cpp}
